                        <span>This project have been made as a semester project at Aalborg University. </span>
                        <span>The idea of this project was to have an interactive bin that could register whenever a user would throw something into it.</span>
                        <span>This would the trigger a small micro-controller that played a rewarding sound.</span>
                        <span>The bin was placed at a big station in Copenhagen and was tested on bypassers.</span>
                        <br>
                        <span>The bin itself were made with a tube as the main body, a wood bottom that was screwed in place, and a multilayered wood lid, with a metal grid on top.</span>
